## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18.x or later recommended)
*   npm or yarn

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dakshh0827/Portfolio.git
    cd Portfolio
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Then, fill in the required values in your `.env` file. The primary contact form (`pages/api/form.ts`) uses Resend. You will need to add/update the following variables:

    ```env
    # --- Mandatory for Core Functionality ---
    # Global
    NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 # Your development (http://localhost:3000) or deployment URL
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME="Daksh Thakran"      # Your site name

    # Google reCAPTCHA v3 (for contact form)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=your_google_recaptcha_v3_site_key
    RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=your_google_recaptcha_v3_secret_key

    # --- Mandatory for Contact Form (Resend) ---
    # These are used by pages/api/form.ts
    RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
    RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=your_verified_resend_from_email@example.com # Email verified with Resend
    RESEND_TO_EMAIL=your_email_to_receive_messages@example.com

    # --- Optional or for alternative configurations (SendGrid) ---
    # These are defined in .env.example and utils/email.ts but not used by the primary contact form
    # EMAIL_FROM=
    # SENDGRID_API_KEY=
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## üìú Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

*   `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`:
    Runs the app in development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
*   `npm run build` or `yarn build`:
    Builds the app for production to the `.next` folder.
*   `npm run start` or `yarn start`:
    Starts the production server (requires a prior build).
*   `npm run lint` or `yarn lint`:
    Runs ESLint to check for code quality and style issues.
*   `npm run postbuild` or `yarn postbuild`:
    Generates the `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` files. This script is automatically run by Next.js after the `build` script completes.

## Club GreenSock Plugins

This project utilizes premium GSAP plugins such as `SplitText`, `CustomEase`, and `ScrambleTextPlugin`.
To use these plugins, you need a Club GreenSock membership.
The `.npmrc` file is configured to fetch these from GreenSock's private NPM registry:
```
//npm.greensock.com/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}
@gsap:registry=https://npm.greensock.com
```
You will need to replace `${NPM_TOKEN}` with your actual GreenSock NPM token, typically by setting it as an environment variable named `NPM_TOKEN` that your `npm install` or `yarn install` process can access. For more details, refer to the [GreenSock NPM installation guide](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Installation/?tab=npm&module=esm&method= secret√°rio#club).

If you do not have a Club GreenSock membership, you might encounter issues resolving these premium plugins during installation or building the project.
